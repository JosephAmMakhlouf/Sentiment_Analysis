It processes text data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in the input.
The notebook demonstrates key steps, including:
=> Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data. 
=> Model Training: Building and training a machine learning model. 
=> Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using standard metrics.
